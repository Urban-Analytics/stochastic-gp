    "This notebook extends the work from the previous notebook, moving from the deterministic `BusSim` model to the stochastic one.\n",
    "The stochastic `BusSim` model introduces random variation into the number of passengers who want to board the bus at each stop - it is now a Poisson process rather than a constant rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This poses an interesting challenge for model emulation.\n",
    "We could now conceivably have different outputs from the model for the same inputs.\n",

    "### Fit the GP\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll actually fit several different models here to try out the effects of changing the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more thorough introduction to the various options available for kernels, see Murphy's [“Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction”]( https://probml.github.io/pml-book/) (2021 edition).\n",
    "Briefly, the two kernels we consider here are Mercer kernels (or positive definite kernels, where the Gram matrix is positive definite for a set of distinct inputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "When we make a prediction via a GP emulator, we need a measure of how similar our input is to the existing input values, as our output will be a weighted combination of the existing inputs.\n",
    "To determine the weights, we need a similarity metric - this is known as a kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The squared exponential kernel is one of the most commonly used:\n",
    "  $$ \\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x'}) = \\exp \\left( - \\frac{|| \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x'} ||^2}{2\\ell^2}\\right)$$\n",
    "There is one hyperparameter, the lengthscale or bandwidth, $\\ell$.\n",
    "For new input $\\mathbf{x'}$ which is similar to $\\mathbf{x}$, the value of $\\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x'})$ will also be large, so the predicted output will be heavily weighted towards that of $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also consider Matern kernels, which give rise to functions which are less smooth than the squared exponential (which is infinitely differentiable).\n",
    "\n",
    "They have two hyperparameters: $\\nu$ (from Bessel function order) and $\\ell$.\n",
    "- $\\nu=1/2$ gives velocity of a particle undergoing Brownian motion, which yields a very jagged function\n",
    "- Higher $\\nu$ values give smoother functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the 5/2 Matern kernel, as it produces functions that are less smooth than the (default) squared exponential.\n",
    "Therefore, it may be better at capturing the variability in arrival times.\n",
    "    \n",
    "There are still further kernels available, some of which cater for more specific cases such as periodic functions.\n",
    "In addition to the book recommended above, Duvenaud's [Kernel Cookbook](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/cookbook/) is another useful resource on kernel choice for GPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each kernel, we fit two GPs.\n",
    "This is to let us investigate the effect of the nugget, which is a small term added to the diagonal of the covariance matrix.\n",
    "Normally, this would help improve the efficiency of the covariance matrix inversion, but the nugget can also be used as a proxy for a small amount of stochastic variation in the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two options that we try are `adaptive`, where the value of the nugget is increased over again until the system can be solved, and `fit`, where the value of the nugget is treated as a hyperparameter which should be fully optimised.\n",
    "These options (along with alternatives) are discussed in the documentation of the `mogp_emulator` package: see [nugget definition](https://mogp-emulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/methods/def/DefNugget.html) and notes on its [implementation](https://mogp-emulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/implementation/GaussianProcess.html#gaussianprocess) in the `GaussianProcess` class."
