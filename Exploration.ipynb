    "In this notebook we will explore the deterministic `BusSim` model from the DUST project and attempt to emulate some of the model outputs using Gaussian Processes.\n",

(2019) is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08288).\n",

    "## Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore how the outputs of `BusSim` model are influenced by selected parameters\n",
    "- Choose the outputs that we want to emulate using a GP\n",

    "  - How well does the emulator perform? How do settings influence this?\n",
    "  - How does the uncertainty estimate of the GP link to the bus movements in the model?\n",
    "- Repeat the above investigation while varing two model parameters\n",
